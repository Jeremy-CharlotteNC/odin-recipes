Repository for the Recipes project in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project 

Introduction

This is the first assigned project - project: recipes - for The Odin Project. It is a review of the HTML information taught in the Foundations Course. 

Reflections

HTML is always fun. But definitely needs some CSS support to look its best. 

I enjoyed the practice. The biggest challenges were not copying the first page and pasting it as a template. I want to shortcut things and know that I'm practicing this to get it back into memory. 

It's also really hard writing plain HTML without formatting. I know that we'll hit CSS lessons soon and visually things will change for the better. I also know that we can do some formatting in HTML, but I know it's a bad habit that I don't want to re-learn.

Overall, it was a fun project. The biggest challenge was keeping focused and not trying to do 'extra' things.
