    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet noodle kugel is perfect anytime! A classic Jewish comfort food, this recipe can be used at holidays throughout the Jewish year or anytime you need something comfortable and creamy.</p>
    <p>Note: You can use homemade egg noodles if you're looking to be a star, but this is supposed to be easy and delicious! Just grab that store-bought package of noodles and get going. This is so delicious no one will know the difference.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wide egg noodles - 12oz package</li>
        <li>Eggs - 4</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Butter, unsalted - 1 stick</li>
        <li>Sour cream, full fat - 8oz package</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt - 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li>Crushed pineapple, drained - 10oz can</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Grease a square baking dish (8x8 or 9x9 works best). You'll want to use a deep square dish here, otherwise your kugel will turn out thin and you won't be able to scoop it up into delicious balls. </li>
        <li>Cook noodles for 8-10 minutes. Follow the package directions here!</li>
        <li>While the noodles cook, place butter in a large bowl</li>
        <li>When the noodles are done, drain them right away and add them right on top of the butter. You'll want the heat from the noodles to help melt your butter.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla then pour it on top of the noodles and mix it up.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed pineapple, sour cream, and salt. Mix it up again.</li>
        <li>Put the noodle mixture into the greased baking dish and put it in the oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the top just starts to look golden.</li>
    </ol>
